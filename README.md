> Let's create a simple Whack-A-Mole clone.

The goal of this traditional game is to prevent "moles" from coming out the ground with a hammer. Every second a new "mole" appears and you'll have to click on it to gently tell her to go back into the soil where it belongs.

If you'd like to spice things up, you can create an increasing difficulty by reducing the timeframe in which the mole appears, and by introducing random delay time between the mole apparition.
